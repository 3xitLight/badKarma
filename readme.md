badKarma is a python3 GTK+ toolkit that aim to assist penetration testers during all the network infrastructure penetration testing activity phases.
It allow testers to save time by having point-and-click access to their toolkits, launch them against single or multiple targets and interacte with them through semplified GUIs or Terminals.


Every task's output is logged under a session file in order to help during reporting phase or in a possible incident response scenario. 
It is also available a proxychains switch that let everything go through proxies, and last but not least, every command can be adjusted before the execution by disabling the "auto-execute" checkbox.

badKarma is licensed under GNU GPL version 3.

## Session file ##
The Session file is just a sqlite database, it contains all the information gained during the activity, real-time updated it can be exported or/and imported from badKarma's GUI.
By default the database is located inside the "/tmp" directory, this means that you have to save it in a different location before rebooting your computer. 

Inside the database there are four tables: hosts, ports, activity_log and notes.

## Targets ##
It is possible to add targets and scan them with nmap and/or masscan from the GUI, some defaults scan profiles are already available as well. 
It is possible to import XML scanners result from the main menu.

There is also a shodan-api's script (smap.py) that let the tester importing target's data directly from shodan. It is located inside the scripts directory and it require a shodan api key inside conf/shodan.conf in order to work.

By default all the scan output are stored inside the "/tmp" directory , then the output is imported in the session file and deleted.

## Extensions ##
badKarma is modular, the extensions are full-interactive and they allow the penetration tester to tune tasks options, since output is logged under the session file, their output can be exported as a raw txt from the "Logs" tab. 

Extensions can be found under the "extension" directory,current available extensions are: 
 - __Shell:__ this is the main module of the toolkit since it allow the tester to execute preconfigured shell tasks. Shell commands are located under the "conf" directory.
 - __Bruter:__ as the name says, bruter is the brute-force extension. It allow the tester to send a target directly to Hydra and configure the parameters through a GUI.
 Default hydra parameters can be modified from conf/bruter.conf.
 - __Screenshot:__ this extension allow the tester to take screenshots of possibile http,rdp,rtsp,vnc and x11 servers, screenshots will be stored in the session file as base64 and can be shown from badKarma.
 - __Browser:__ just an "open in browser" for http menu item, take it as an example to build your own extensions.
 - __WebSession:__ todo.
